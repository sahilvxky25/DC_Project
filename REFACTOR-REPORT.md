# Refactor report

> **Report status (updated 8 November 2026):** Sections 1–9 preserve the record of the original modularization and the tests performed at that time. Section 10 records important feature work merged into `main` afterward. The historical test results below must not be interpreted as a fresh regression test of the current application.

## Original refactor scope

The initial refactor split the three-file project (`index.html`, one `css/style.css`, one ~3,000-line concatenated `js/app.js`) into ES modules and ordered stylesheets. Its stated goal was to preserve behaviour, apart from the explicitly documented changes. The original three files were left untouched in the original working environment.

## 1. Structure before and after

**Before**: `index.html` + `css/style.css` (one file) + `js/app.js` (one file; 12 source sections concatenated; ~180 top-level names sharing one global scope).

**After**: `index.html` + 9 stylesheets + 56 JavaScript files in `core/`, `simulations/`, `app/`, `lab/`, `modules/` (see README section 2 for the tree).

Deviations from the proposed layout (the proposal said to adapt):
* `lab/` was added. The four core-lab stages mix DOM and simulation tightly, so they got their own folder instead of being scattered across `simulations/` and `app/`.
* `simulations/` is named by topic (`arq.js`, `congestion.js`, `dissector.js`, `capture.js` ...) instead of `flow-control.js` / `transport.js` only, because the code did not fall into the proposed ten buckets. `transmission.js` was not created: the transmit loop is animation code and lives in `lab/transmission-stage.js`.
* `modules/advanced/` was added for encapsulation, packet capture and troubleshooting (they belong to no single layer). Sockets/NAT sits in `transport-layer/`.
* `css/dashboard.css` was added so the dashboard rules could keep their original position in the cascade (after components, before the lab).
* `core/addressing.js` holds the pure IPv4/IPv6 maths; there is no separate `simulations/addressing.js` because nothing remained to put in it.

## 2. Where the old sections went

| Old section | New location |
|-------------|--------------|
| 01 util | `core/utils.js`, `encoding.js`, `checksums.js`, `addressing.js` (IP helpers), `ui-helpers.js`, `state.js` |
| 02 sim | `simulations/arq.js`, `congestion.js`, `routing.js` |
| 03 net | `simulations/packet-builders.js`, `dns-wire.js`, `dissector.js`, `capture.js` |
| 04 shell | `app/router.js`, `navigation.js`, `dashboard.js`, `progress.js`, `notifications.js`, `theme.js`, `core/storage.js`, `modules/registry.js`, `core/ui-helpers.js` (icons), `app.js` (`boot`) |
| 05 lab | `lab/*.js` + `simulations/packetization.js` |
| 06 link | `modules/link-layer/framing.js`, `error-detection.js` + `simulations/framing.js`, `error-detection.js` |
| 07 arq | `modules/link-layer/stop-and-wait.js`, `sliding-window.js` |
| 08 network | `modules/network-layer/*` + address maths in `core/addressing.js` |
| 09 transport | `modules/transport-layer/*` + `simulations/transport.js` |
| 10 app | `modules/application-layer/*` + `simulations/dns.js`, `http-tls.js` |
| 11 adv | `modules/advanced/*` + `simulations/encapsulation.js`, `troubleshooting.js` |
| 12 learn | `modules/learning/*` |
| 99 boot | bottom of `app.js` |

## 3. How it was done (so it is trustworthy)

The code was **moved mechanically, not retyped**. A script parsed every top-level declaration with a real JavaScript parser (acorn), resolved which names each declaration uses (scope-aware, so a local variable that happens to share a global's name is not confused with it), assigned each declaration to its new file, and generated every `import` and `export` line from that analysis. Code was then formatted with Prettier (whitespace only) and documentation was inserted. Nothing was hand-copied between files.

## 4. Shared-state and dependency decisions

* `DC` (module registry) and `S` (core-lab state) live in `core/state.js`: one definition, imported everywhere.
* `P` (saved progress) lives in `core/storage.js` as `export let P`. It used to be reassigned from the dashboard's reset button; an importing file cannot reassign an imported binding, so that logic became `resetProgress()` in `core/storage.js`. Because imports are live bindings, every file sees the new object. (See section 5.)
* Router-private variables `cleanup` and `currentKey`, and the lab's `labSig` and tab counter `tabUid`, stay private to the one file that uses them.
* Helpers used by only one module stayed inside that module's file (e.g. `cwndChart`, `colorHttp`, `journeyData`) instead of becoming exports.
* No circular imports between files (verified by script). `app/` and `lab/` depend on each other at folder level only.
* Nothing is attached to `window` any more (the classic script version shared a global scope).

## 5. Behaviour changes (unavoidable or deliberate)

1. **Must be served over HTTP.** ES modules do not load from `file://`. Use `python3 -m http.server`.
2. **`resetProgress()`** replaces the inline reset code (same result: clears everything, keeps theme).
3. **`--coral` colour token added** in `css/tokens.css` as an alias of `--bad`. The lab script paints a corrupted packet with `var(--coral)`, but my earlier stylesheet never defined that variable, so the corrupted packet was not recoloured. This is a one-line fix to a latent bug, flagged here instead of being hidden in the refactor.
4. Globals such as `DC`, `P`, `S` are no longer visible in the browser console.
5. Stylesheet text was reformatted by Prettier (one declaration per line); rules and their order are unchanged.

## 6. Observations left alone (not fixed on purpose)

* `field()` (core/ui-helpers.js) and `rid()` (core/utils.js) are never used. Kept.
* `analyzeCapture()` declares an unused `first = {}`; `compileFilter()` contains `(isIp || true)` which is always true. Harmless; left as they were.
* `transmit()` declares a local `const P = S.P` that shadows the progress object `P` inside that function (it does not use progress there). Confusing but correct; renaming it would be a good first clean-up.
* The **Stop** button takes effect when the current animation step finishes (up to ~1.5 s at "Slow" speed), because cancellation is checked after each `await`. Original behaviour.
* `P_RUNS_ADD` has an unusual name for a function; renaming it would be safe now that everything is traceable.

## 7. Tests actually executed (Chromium via Playwright, files served over HTTP)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax/parse of all 56 files as ES modules, every import resolves to an existing export | pass |
| Circular imports between files | none |
| Unused imports | none |
| All 25 routes load (dashboard, 4 lab stages, 20 modules), every tab opened, no console/page errors | pass |
| Stress test: change every select/slider, click ~60 controls per screen, two passes, every tab | pass (no errors) |
| **Equivalence**: rendered HTML of 50 screen/tab states compared with the original build (seeded `Math.random`, dark theme) | **0 differences** |
| **Pixel comparison**: 38 screenshots (desktop dark + phone light) vs original | 25 identical; 13 differ only by a 2-4 px sliver that the *original* also produces between two of its own runs (renderer noise) |
| Core lab: send "Hello, 世界" at 0% loss, receiver decodes it | pass |
| Tutorials auto-tick from real simulator actions; quiz scores | pass |
| Direct link, unknown route fallback, back/forward | pass |
| Theme persists after reload; progress persists; old/partial and corrupted saves tolerated; reset | pass |
| Empty message disables Transmit; Stop; link toggle; navigating away mid-run | pass |
| Horizontal overflow at 390 px width on 7 screens (dark theme) | none |
| `crc32("123456789") == 0xCBF43926` (standard check value) | pass |
| README "add a module" recipe actually creates a working module in the sidebar | pass |

## 8. Still needs a human

* Firefox and Safari (only Chromium was run).
* Keyboard-only and screen-reader walkthrough (focus styles and ARIA were preserved but not re-audited with assistive technology).
* A real phone (only an emulated 390 px viewport).
* The Google Fonts links need internet access; offline the app falls back to system fonts.

## 9. Git

See README section 12. Short version: work on a branch, commit as one change, keep `main` untouched until verified.


## 10. Subsequent development recorded on `main` (through 8 November 2026)

The original modularization was followed by several feature additions and fixes. These changes expand the application beyond the initial snapshot described in sections 1–9.

### End-to-end transmission now supports binary media

The core transmission journey was extended beyond text to support:
- Images
- Videos
- Documents
- Audio files

The binary-media flow includes file selection and preview, byte-oriented metadata, packetization, animated transmission, receiver-side reassembly, and reconstructed output. Upload validation was also improved so unsupported formats and files exceeding configured size limits display a visible warning instead of silently failing.

**Architecture note:** The feature is integrated into the existing core lab rather than being a separate standalone simulator. The main workflow remains organized under `js/lab/`, with supporting logic in `js/simulations/` and the learning journey UI in the relevant learning module.

### Error correction added alongside error detection

The link-layer learning module now covers both detecting errors and attempting to recover corrupted data. The implementation includes:
- SECDED Hamming code
- Two-dimensional parity with correction support
- Reed–Solomon RS(15,11) demonstration
- Error-pattern injection and interactive correction workflows

The correction activities were subsequently revised to be more button-driven and easier to follow. Detection and correction are distinct concepts: a detection method can identify corruption without necessarily recovering the original data.

Relevant implementation areas include `js/modules/link-layer/error-detection.js` and supporting simulation files under `js/simulations/`.

### Encryption and decryption learning lab expanded

The advanced learning area now includes stage-by-stage encryption/decryption demonstrations for:
- Caesar cipher (classical teaching example)
- XOR byte cipher (educational example)
- AES-256-GCM
- RSA-OAEP with AES-GCM hybrid encryption
- ECDH P-256 key agreement with AES-GCM
- SHA-256 hashing

The lab exposes intermediate processing stages and receiver-side results. SHA-256 is a one-way hash, not an encryption algorithm. Caesar and XOR are intentionally insecure teaching examples; these demonstrations are not a substitute for vetted production cryptography.

Primary UI implementation: `js/modules/advanced/encryption.js`. Supported modern cryptographic operations rely on the browser Web Crypto API.

### DNS learning now includes a hosted iterative lookup option

In addition to the simulated DNS hierarchy and cache, a live iterative-resolution learning tab was added. It uses a separately hosted DNS resolver worker and includes CNAME traversal handling and a configurable/persisted worker endpoint.

This introduces an external deployment dependency for the live lookup feature. The local simulated DNS lesson remains a separate educational mode. Review the DNS worker deployment instructions in the README before expecting the live lookup to work on a fresh deployment.

### Other recorded improvements

- The congestion-window event selector was fixed so the selected event scenario refreshes the visualization.
- The error-correction workflow and its validation/interaction design were polished.
- The end-to-end journey was updated to understand binary media rather than assuming every message is text.
- README documentation was refreshed to describe the current feature set, Firebase setup, local development, project layout, troubleshooting, and simulation limitations.

### Current architecture at a glance

The project continues to use native JavaScript ES modules and the existing module-registration pattern:
- `js/app.js` is the application entry point and imports modules for registration.
- `js/modules/registry.js` defines the learning groups and the four core-lab stages.
- `js/modules/` contains the learning-module interfaces.
- `js/simulations/` contains reusable protocol, encoding, error-control, and network simulation logic.
- `js/lab/` contains the end-to-end transmission stages.
- `js/core/` contains shared state, encoding, storage, addressing, and UI helpers.
- `js/app/` contains routing, navigation, progress, search, and related application behaviour.
- `js/auth/` contains Firebase client and account flows.

The module registry currently describes seven learning groups: Link and errors, Reliable transfer, Network layer, Transport layer, Application layer, Advanced, and Journey and learning. It also defines four core-lab stages: Message & Encoding, Packetization, Transmission Lab, and Receiver & Reconstruction.

### Verification status and limitations

The test table in section 7 belongs to the original refactor validation run. The later feature commits listed above document implementation work and fixes, but this report update did not execute a new browser test suite, cross-browser test, accessibility audit, or end-to-end regression run.

Before treating the current `main` branch as fully verified, run the current application and specifically retest:
1. Text, image, video, document, and audio transmission, including invalid type/oversized-file warnings and receiver reconstruction.
2. Error detection and each correction workflow, including correctable and uncorrectable patterns.
3. Every encryption mode, stage-by-stage output, file handling where supported, and receiver verification.
4. Simulated DNS/cache behaviour and live iterative DNS with a correctly configured worker endpoint.
5. Congestion-window differences for duplicate-ACK and timeout scenarios.
6. Authentication, account-isolated Firestore progress, navigation, responsive layouts, and browser Back/Forward.
7. Firefox, Safari, keyboard-only navigation, screen-reader behaviour, and a physical mobile device.

No claim is made here that these newer workflows have passed those tests. Record actual browser, environment, test date, and outcome when the checks are performed.

## 11. Repository security and contribution documentation (14 November 2026)

The documentation branch `docs/security-and-contributing` adds repository-level guidance alongside the existing application documentation:

- **`SECURITY.md`** describes how to report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature, what evidence to include, responsible testing boundaries, and coordinated disclosure expectations. It explicitly directs reporters away from public issues and pull requests for vulnerability details.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** documents local setup, branch and commit conventions, project architecture conventions, testing expectations, secret handling, and pull request requirements. It points security reports to the private process in `SECURITY.md`.
- **`README.md`** now links to both policy documents in dedicated Security and Contributing sections.

These additions are documentation-only. They do not add an in-app security reporting form, enable GitHub private vulnerability reporting in repository settings, or change application runtime behaviour. The private reporting option must be enabled and available in the repository's GitHub Security settings for that route to work; otherwise, reporters are directed to contact the maintainer privately.

No application tests were run for these documentation changes. Review the two policy files whenever repository ownership, supported versions, reporting channels, or contribution workflows change.
