/**
 * learning module: Challenges and checks
 *
 * Quizzes drawn from a question bank plus freshly generated calculations.
 *
 * This file registers one learning module with regMod(). Its mount(root) function builds the screen inside
 * `root` and attaches event handlers; the function mount() returns (if any) is its cleanup, called by the router
 * when the learner leaves, so timers and listeners do not outlive the screen. The protocol logic lives in
 * ../../simulations/ and ../../core/; this file is the user interface for it.
 *
 * Imports:
 *   - ../../core/encoding.js (bytes, hex, bits and UTF-8 helpers): bin8
 *   - ../../core/storage.js (saved progress (localStorage) and the shared P object): P
 *   - ../../core/ui-helpers.js (shared HTML builders: icons, tables, tabs, ladder diagrams): panel, statRow, tbl, vd
 *   - ../../core/utils.js (tiny DOM, math and timing helpers): $, $$, esc
 *   - ../../simulations/framing.js (byte stuffing and bit stuffing (data-link framing)): bitStuff
 *   - ../registry.js (learning-module registry and group definitions): regMod
 *   - ../../app/progress.js (achievements, flags and statistics): setStat, stat
 *
 * Exports: (none)
 *
 * Used by: (imported only for its side effects by app.js)
